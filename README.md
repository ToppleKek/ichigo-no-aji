# Ichigo!

A simple, from scratch, minimal dependency game engine for 2D side scrolling games.

## Building

On Windows, if you have MSYS2 or git bash installed, you can use `build.sh build` to build the game. Edit `build.sh` and change the `MODE` variable to `release` to build a release build.

Alternatively, run the `win32_build_debug.bat` batch script. You must have clang installed and in the PATH in both situations.
